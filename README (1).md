## Overall Learning 

> During this six-month internship, I gained practical knowledge in networking and system configuration. I learned how to design networks from scratch, configure devices, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and understand real-world network architecture. Along with technical skills, I also developed soft skills through SST sessions and gained additional knowledge through LST. I had the opportunity to participate in community services such as blood donation, tree plantation, and serving food to senior citizens, which made this internship a valuable and well-rounded learning experience for me.

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project">Project : Secure Network Configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer(CAN Network) </h3>
<p>
The Secure Network Configuration project was implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, where I designed and configured a Campus Area Network (CAN) from scratch with a strong focus on security. The project involved creating VLANs for network segmentation, configuring routing and ACLs to control traffic, and applying basic security measures to prevent unauthorized access. As a cyber security enthusiast, this project helped me gain practical understanding of secure network design, traffic management, and real-world security implementation, while improving my troubleshooting skills and confidence in protecting network infrastructures.
